I'm a machine learning engineer at [IGS Energy](https://www.igs.com/) where I design energy demand forecasting models for more than 1M buildings in the US and develop other ML/AI-powered tools.

Prior to this, I was a researcher at [UT Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/) working on robust representation learning in class-imbalanced scenarios under the supervision of [Prof. Rishabh Iyer](https://sites.google.com/view/rishabhiyer/home).
