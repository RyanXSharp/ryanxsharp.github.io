I'm a machine learning engineer at [IGS Energy](https://www.igs.com/) where I design energy demand forecasting models and other ML/AI-powered tools.

Prior to this, I was a graduate researcher at [UT Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/) working on representation learning under the supervision of [Prof. Rishabh Iyer](https://sites.google.com/view/rishabhiyer/home).

# This resulted in [SMILe](https://anaymajee.me/assets/project_pages/smile) getting accepted at ECCV 2024, main track.

# Before I discovered my passion for AI, I inspired thousands of youth and adults from around the world to improve their fitness with weightlifting. [My YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@RyanXSharp) has attracted more than 13 million total views and 85,000 subscribers by showcasing my workout videos and documenting my bodybuilding journey.
